		<b>Mensa</b> is a generic, flexible, enhanced, and efficient
		implementation of a pattern matching state machine as described by the
		1975 paper, <i><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145%2F360825.360855"
			target="_blank">Efficient string matching: An aid to
				bibliographic search</a></i>, by Alfred Aho and Margaret Corasick. This
		implementation is
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><i>generic</i> in that it can be used to match any type of
			symbols as defined by the Java template type S â€” e.g., it is possible
			to create a machine to match bytes, characters, integers, gene
			sequences, bit sequences, etc.;</li>
		<li><i>flexible</i> in that the architecture allows for granular
			extension, customization, or replacement of framework components;</li>
		<li><i>enhanced</i> in that it supports a number of useful
			extension not addressed in the original paper, such as whole-word
			matching, case-sensitivity controls, fuzzy whitespace matching, fuzzy
			punctuation matching, incremental matching (i.e., iterators),
			matching event listeners, etc.; and</li>
		<li><i>efficient</i> in that it performs well in terms of both
			time and resource usages on very large (~million) keyword sets.</li>
	</ul>
